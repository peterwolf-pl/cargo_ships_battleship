    - Oil rigs now have 4 pipe connection points and can pass through fluid, and can no longer be rotated.
    - Oil rigs and their components can be blueprinted.
    - Overhauled Offshore Oil generation:
    - Offshore oil is now treated as a separate resource on the map generation page. It will only generate on Nauvis.
    - Overhauled Lifting Bridges to improve performance:
    - Lifting Bridges can be fully blueprinted, ghost-placed, robot-build, destroyed by damage, and rebuilt by robots.
    - Lifting Bridges now use the gate prototype to stay open normally, and close automatically when trains (or players) approach without the need for scripted entity creation/deletion.
  Changes:
    - Oil rigs now consume oil to generate power (this improves the smoke graphics performance and visuals).
    - Oil rig component icons now show what part they are (generator, radar, pole or tank).

    - Removed the setting to disable oil on land. Do this by disabling Crude Oil in map generation. Remember to manually enable the "No oil for oil rig" option to unlock the technology correctly.

    - Stack size for big ships and oil rig reduced to 1.
    - There will be some graphical glitches with Lifting Bridges if trains or ships traverse before the bridge state settles, but it will always return to a good state and requires no scripting overhead to function.

    - Many minor graphical and performance improvements.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that blueprinting ships and boats on waterways would not store fuel requests.
