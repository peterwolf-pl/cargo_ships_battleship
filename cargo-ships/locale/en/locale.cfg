offshore-oil=Large deposit of deep sea oil. Extract with the oil rig.
port=Destinations for automated ships.
buoy=Divides the waterway system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
bridge_base=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Place along an existing straight stretch of waterway.
